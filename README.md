# FATFileRecoveryPy

FATFileRecoveryPy is a Python-based tool designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the process of recovering deleted files from a FAT (File Allocation Table) file system. The tool reads the file system structure at a low level, identifies deleted files, and attempts to recover them.

## Disclaimer

This tool is a simplified example and is intended for educational purposes only. It may not handle all edge cases or variations of the FAT file system. For critical data recovery, it is recommended to use professional data recovery tools or services. Always work on a copy of the file system to avoid further data loss.

## Features

- Reads and interprets the FAT file system structure.
- Identifies deleted files in the root directory.
- Recovers and saves deleted files.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
